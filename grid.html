        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>They scream and they cry much as you're doing now.
            Search him. Then I will kill you.
            Bruce... it's okay. Don't be afraid.
            I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.
            If you can tell me the Russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion."
            You care about justice? Look beyond your own pain, Bruce. This city is rotting.
            I give a damn because a good man once made me responsible for what was most precious to him in the whole world.
            You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse             before they get better.
            Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you.
            It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.
            That's a lovely lovely voice!
            I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.
            Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.
            It doesn't matter who we are. What matters is our plan.

        Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends           his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.
        Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.
        I think you and your friend have found the last game in town. where it hurts, their wallets. It's bold. You gonna count me in?
